# Water Potability Analysis

This repository focuses on analyzing water quality data to assess potability, applying various data science and machine learning techniques to classify water as potable (safe to drink) or non-potable. This project is valuable for environmental analysts, public health professionals, and data scientists working on water quality monitoring and prediction.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputes missing values using statistical methods to ensure a complete dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforms and scales features such as pH, hardness, solids, and turbidity to improve model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visualizes the distribution of each water quality parameter, identifying any skewness or abnormalities.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines relationships between variables to identify key indicators of potability.
- **Outlier Detection**: Uses statistical techniques to detect and handle outliers, enhancing data quality and robustness.

### 3. Machine Learning for Classification
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model to classify water as potable or non-potable.
- **Decision Tree & Random Forest**: Tree-based models to capture complex relationships in the data, often providing interpretable results.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Employs SVM to classify data based on pH, solids, turbidity, and other chemical parameters.
- **XGBoost**: Advanced boosting algorithm for improved accuracy in water potability prediction.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy, Precision, and Recall**: Assesses model performance with standard metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
- **ROC Curve & AUC**: Plots ROC curves to evaluate model sensitivity and specificity, helping identify the best model for water classification.
- **Cross-Validation**: Uses cross-validation to validate model robustness and prevent overfitting.

### 5. Interpretability and Feature Importance
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies which factors (e.g., pH, chlorides) most strongly influence water potability.
- **SHAP Values**: Applies SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to visualize and interpret the impact of each feature on the model predictions.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean, impute, and transform water quality data.
- **EDA and Visualization**: Jupyter notebooks with visualizations to explore data characteristics.
- **Modeling**: Code for training, tuning, and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Results**: Performance metrics, plots, and visualizations showing model outcomes.
